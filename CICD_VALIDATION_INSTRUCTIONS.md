- Active internet connection

### **3. Quick Validation**
```bash
# Run the complete validation suite
python3 run_cicd_validation.py

# Or run simplified backend tests
python3 simple_cicd_test.py
```

## 📋 **VALIDATION PHASES**

### **Phase 1: System Initialization (0-2 minutes)**

**Expected Outcome**: Fully functional dashboard interface

### **Phase 3: Project Selection & Pinning (4-7 minutes)**
**Objective**: Test project management functionality

**Tests**:
- ✅ Project dropdown lists available repositories
- ✅ Project can be selected and pinned to dashboard
- ✅ Project card appears with correct information
- ✅ Webhook URL is automatically set on GitHub repo
- ✅ Project card shows "ready" status

**Expected Outcome**: Project successfully pinned with webhook configured

### **Phase 4: Settings Configuration (7-10 minutes)**
**Objective**: Validate all project settings can be configured

**Tests**:
- ✅ Planning Statement can be set and saved
- ✅ Repository Rules can be added and persist
- ✅ Setup Commands can be configured and tested
- ✅ Secrets can be added securely
- ✅ Auto-Confirm Plan checkbox functions
- ✅ All settings persist between sessions

**Expected Outcome**: All project settings configured and functional

### **Phase 5: Agent Run Creation (10-15 minutes)**
**Objective**: Test the core agent run workflow

**Tests**:
- ✅ "Agent Run" button opens text dialog
- ✅ Target text can be entered and submitted
- ✅ Request is sent to Codegen API with proper context
- ✅ Planning Statement is included in request
- ✅ Progress is displayed on project card
- ✅ Response is received and displayed

**Expected Outcome**: Agent run successfully initiated and monitored

### **Phase 6: Plan Confirmation & PR Creation (15-20 minutes)**
**Objective**: Validate plan handling and PR generation

**Tests**:
- ✅ Plan response is displayed correctly
- ✅ Confirm/Modify buttons function properly
- ✅ Plan confirmation triggers PR creation
- ✅ PR notification appears on project card
- ✅ GitHub PR is created with correct content
- ✅ PR link is accessible and functional

**Expected Outcome**: PR successfully created and linked to project card

### **Phase 7: Grainchain Snapshot & Deployment (20-25 minutes)**
**Objective**: Test automated deployment validation

**Tests**:
- ✅ Grainchain snapshot is created automatically
- ✅ PR codebase is cloned into snapshot
- ✅ Setup commands execute successfully
- ✅ Graph-sitter and web-eval-agent are pre-installed
- ✅ Environment variables are properly configured
- ✅ Deployment validation completes without errors

**Expected Outcome**: Clean deployment environment ready for testing

### **Phase 8: Web-Eval-Agent Comprehensive Testing (25-28 minutes)**
**Objective**: Validate all UI components and workflows

**Tests**:
- ✅ All UI components are functional
- ✅ All user flows work correctly
- ✅ Error handling is appropriate
- ✅ Performance meets requirements
- ✅ Accessibility standards are met
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility verified

**Expected Outcome**: Complete UI validation with no critical issues

### **Phase 9: Auto-Merge Execution (28-30 minutes)**
**Objective**: Test the final auto-merge functionality

**Tests**:
- ✅ Auto-merge checkbox setting is respected
- ✅ PR is automatically merged to main branch
- ✅ Deployment pipeline triggers correctly
- ✅ Production deployment is successful
- ✅ Post-merge validation completes
- ✅ Project card updates to reflect completion

**Expected Outcome**: Complete autonomous CI/CD cycle from request to production

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Performance Benchmarks**
- Total flow completion: < 30 minutes
- Dashboard loading: < 5 seconds
- Agent run initiation: < 10 seconds
- PR creation: < 5 minutes

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues**

**Backend Not Responding**
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/
# Restart if needed
cd backend && python api.py
```

**Frontend Not Loading**
```bash
# Check frontend service
curl http://localhost:3000/
# Restart if needed
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

**Web-Eval-Agent Errors**
```bash
# Verify Gemini API key
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY
# Check browser dependencies
pip install browser-use playwright
playwright install chromium
```

**Webhook Issues**
```bash
# Verify Cloudflare worker is accessible
curl https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/
# Check GitHub webhook configuration
gh api repos/owner/repo/hooks
```
